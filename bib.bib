@article{kapulkin,
	abstract = {In this paper, we construct and investigate a model of the Univalent Foundations of Mathematics in the category of simplicial sets. To this end, we first give a new technique for constructing models of dependent type theory, using universes to obtain coherence. We then construct a (weakly) universal Kan fibration, and use it to exhibit a model in simplicial sets. Lastly, we introduce the Univalence Axiom, in several equivalent formulations, and show that it holds in our model. As a corollary, we conclude that Univalent Foundations are at least as consistent as ZFC with two inaccessible cardinals.},
